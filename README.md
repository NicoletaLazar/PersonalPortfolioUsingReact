# Personal Portfolio Using React
This project is a static portfolio created using React, Chakra UI, Yup frameworks.

Welcome to my portfolio page! This project showcases my skills and experienced in a static website built using React, Chakra UI and Yup frameworks. The portfolio page will be a single page that will contain four sections:
- **A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
- **A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
- **A section to display ideas of projects as cards in a grid fashion
- **A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact me

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Content**: Content such as ideas of projects, skills and experiences are easily manageable and dynamically rendered using React.
- **Validation**: Form validation is implemented using the Yup framework to ensure data integrity and user input correctness.
